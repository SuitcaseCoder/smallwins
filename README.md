### notes for myself: 

#### Next Steps: 
- handle user registration. 
    - on Register(signup) send username and password to the backend ("/register") via a POST request on the frontend
    - if user was registered correctly, redirect to the `today` page
- handle user login
    - onLogin send username and password to the backend ('/login') via GET / POST request? 
    - if successful, redirect to a today page
    - if unsuccessful, redirect to sign up page
